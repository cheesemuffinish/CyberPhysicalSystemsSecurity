For this project I decided to attack the system by making the box fall off at the end. I did this by switching the boolean value of the Sensor B to make the crate fall off the end of the convayer belt. it worked because the current code was making the box stop when it reached the sensor B value making it stationary. As an attacker I switched the boolean to make the convayer belt continue which disrupted the nominal case of the PLC system. In the attached PCAP file I listening in on the IP provided by the ubuntu server and saw the traffic from the FactoryIO server in the wireshark capture. The run include 2 nominal runs with tampering at the end of the first nominal run and an independent run of the attack file.
